                <h1> Introduction </h1>
                <p>
                    The Gene Ontology pipeline attempts to streamline the process of building a dataset for functional annotation. 
                    Based on the options selected on the dataset_form homepage, a large set of protein annotations will be extracted from 
                    the <a href=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA>GOA database</a>, filtered, and postprocessed. The resulting tab separated file 
                    can be used directly for training or evaluating models. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <h1> Benchmark Compatibility</h1>
                <p>
                    Training and validation sets returned by our form are designed to avoid conflicts with all datasets from 
                    "Benchmarking Gene ontology Function Predictions Using Negative Annotations" (Vesztrocy, Dessimoz 2020). 

                    Datasets may also be made compliant with the CAFA Challenge by filtering by the proper maximum date. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <h1> Evidence Codes </h1>
                <p>
                    The evidence codes in our form represent possible sources for protein - GO term associations. Select an evidence 
                    code to add all terms found using that method to your dataset. <br> <br>
                    
                    A quick guide to evidence codes can be found here: <a href="http://geneontology.org/docs/guide-go-evidence-codes/"> Evidence Code Guide</a>. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <h1> Propogate Annotations</h1>
                <p>
                    Our Gene Ontology dataset maps proteins to the associated GO terms, but only actually stores the most 
                    specific term associated with a given protein. For instance, we might store an association between the protein Q13219 and 
                    the GO term "hexose biosynthetic process", but we wouldn't explicitely store an association between Q13219 and the more general 
                    term "metabolic process". <br> <br>

                    The propogate annotations option augments our dataset with these implicit associations before returning anything. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <h1>Max Date</h1>
                <p>
                    Enter a maximum date to exclude recent protein - term associations from your dataset.  
                </p>
                <br>
                <h1> Negative Annotations (Coming Soon)</h1>
                <p>
                    Very few negative annotations are explicitely provided by any dataset. However, there are methods for identifying
                    very probably negative annotations. <br> <br>

                    Our pipeline extracts probably negative samples using the NegGOA process introduced in 
                    "NegGOA: Negative GO Annotations Selection Using Ontology Structure" (Fu, Wang, Yang, Yu 2020). A subset of these annotations, 
                    equal in size to the returned positive annotations, may be returned along with the other data. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <h1> </h1>
                <h1> Download Format</h1>
                <p>
                    Your dataset will come in the form of a gzipped tar archive. On a bash terminal or command prompt, it can be unpacked with
                    the command " tar -xvzf <filepath>". The resulting files correspond to the training, validation, and testing files of the Gene
                    Ontology domains selected in the form. <br> <br>

                    Each file contains two tab-separated columns, with the first column storing UniProt protein IDs, and the second containing
                    a comma separated list of the associated Gene Ontology terms. 
                </p>
